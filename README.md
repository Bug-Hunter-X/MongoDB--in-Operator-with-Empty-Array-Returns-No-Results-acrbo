# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The expected behavior might be to return all documents when the array is empty, but instead, it returns an empty result set.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file shows an example query where `$in` is used with an empty array.  This query is intended to select all documents but incorrectly returns no results.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a solution using conditional logic to avoid the issue.   If the input array is empty, it constructs a query that matches all documents.
